Highlights
-----------------
- **Datasets:** We present real-life sonar datasets for pretraining and transfer learning evaluations
- **SSL Approaches:** We study 3 self-supervised learning algorithms to learn representations without labels (RotNet, Denoising Autoencoders, Jigsaw Puzzle)
- **Pretrained Models:** We provide pretrained models for further computer vision research on sonar image datasets
